# Wall of Open Source
This is just a fun project where developers can make their first open source contributions easily.  

This project is created with just HTML and CSS so that even beginners can make contributions easily.  

The only thing that you're required to do is add your own card that has your details. Like down below :point_down:

The code is simple, just duplicate from where the comments say and then add your own details
```
              <!-- DUPLICATE THIS CODE BLOCK -->
                <!-- Person Card -->
                  <div class="card">
                      <div class="card-image">
                          link to your image
                      </div>
                      <div class="card-content">
                          <h3 class="card-content-name" id="my-name">your name</h3>
                          <p class="card-content-text" id="about-me">Who are you and what do you do?.</p>

                          <div class="card-icons">
                              <ul>
                                  <li><a href="https://twitter.com/YOUR TWITTER HANDLE" target="_blank"><i
                                              class="fa-brands fa-twitter"></i></a></li>
                                  <li><a href="https://github.com/GITHUB USERNAME" target="_blank"><i
                                              class="fa-brands fa-github"></i></a></li>
                                   <!-- you can add as many more lists with your social links as you desire -->
                              </ul>
                          </div>
                      </div>
                  </div>
